# Deno-Staticfile-Template
A really simplistic example on how to serve html and stylesheet files using Deno and Oak.

Run: `deno run --allow-net --allow-read mod.ts`

Btw the webdesign on this project is absolutely beautiful.

Uh sure... you can add more cars :D. (Checkout the routes.ts file and the html files in the public/cars directory)
